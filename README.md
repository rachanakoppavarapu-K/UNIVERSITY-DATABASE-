# UNIVERSITY-DATABASE-

This repository contains the complete implementation of a University Management System using SQL. It includes the creation of database schemas, tables, sample data with realistic student names, and various SQL queries demonstrating data manipulation, aggregation, joins, transactions, indexing, and advanced techniques like CTEs and set operations.

The project demonstrates:
✔ Table creation with primary and foreign keys  
✔ Data insertion with meaningful records  
✔ Complex queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregation functions  
✔ Transactions, indexing, and constraints  
✔ Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions  
✔ Set operations like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`
